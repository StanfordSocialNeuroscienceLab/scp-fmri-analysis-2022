# Utility Scripts

* `open_survey.py`: This is hard-coded to open pre- and post-scan Qualtrics survey for a given Subject ID in a web browser.

* `t1_processor.py`: This script creates and saves anatomical images for each participant (or a given participant, depending on the command line arg). We supply participants with an anatomical image as one component of their compensation, and this also allows you to easily sanity check your data.
